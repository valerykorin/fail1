	<h2>History</h2>
	<p> Our founders, Valery & Ksenia, incorporate their pet superstore concept as Durham Pet Store, Inc. in 1996. Our first two stores, originally called PetFood Warehouse, open in New Hampshire in 1997. In 2005 we committed to helping save lives, all 3 stores work with local animal welfare groups to hold fundraising and pet adoption events.</p>
